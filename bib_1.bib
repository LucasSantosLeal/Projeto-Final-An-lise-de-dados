A longer title for the section could have been ‘‘Forecasting crime for policy and planning decisions and in support of tactical deployment of police resources.’’ Crime forecasting for police is relatively new. It has been made relevant by recent criminological theories, made possible by recent information technologies including geographic information systems (GIS), and made desirable because of innovative crime management practices. While focused primarily on the police component of the criminal justice system, the six papers provide a wide range of forecasting settings and models including UK and US jurisdictions, long- and short-term horizons, univariate and multivariate methods, and ﬁxed boundary versus ad hoc spatial cluster areal units for the space and time series data. Furthermore, the papers include several innovations for forecast models, with many driven by unique features of the problem area and data.},

However, there is a dearth of literature in the context of developing countries. This paper is an attempt to address this deficiency. The paper investigates the relative impact of deterrence variables (load on police force, arrest rates, charge sheet rates, conviction rates and quick disposal of cases) and socio-economic variables (economic growth, poverty,, urbanization and education) on crime rates in India. State-level data is collected on the above variables for the period 1999 to 2005.Zellner’s SURE model is used to estimate the model. Subsequently, this is extended by introducing endogeneity. The results show that both deterrence and socioeconomic factors are important in explaining crime rates. However, some of their effects are different from that observed in studies for developed countries.},

To test the hypothesis, the study uses recent state level data on violent crime from FBI uniform crime reports. Fixed effect regression was used to analyze the data. The results indicated that there is a positive relationship between income inequality and crime. An increase in the level of inequality by one unit will result in an increase in violent crime by 330. We also found that control variables, such as state and local government expenditures on policing and public safety, and community development reduce violent crime. Other factors, such as education and population density are not statistically significant, showing they do not directly affect crime. These results help us better understand the determinants of violent crime and what must be done to reduce criminality in our society. First, there have to be policy measures to diminish the trend towards increased income inequality in order to reduce delinquency. Second, states have to continue dedicating adequate resources towards policing and public safety, and increase community development, in order to reduce crime.},

As social order became a greater concern for the public authorities, interest in investigating incentives pushing individuals towards engaging in illegal activities has become a central issue of the political agenda. Building on the existing literature, this paper proposes to focus on a few primary determinants of crime, whose eﬀect is investigated using a Responsiveness Scores (RS) approach performed over 50 US states during the period 2000–2012. The RS approach allows us to account for unit heterogeneous response to each single determinant, thus paving the way to a more in-depth analysis of the relation between crime and its drivers. We attempt to overcome the limitations posed by standard regression methods, which assume a single coeﬃcient for all determinants, thus contributing to the literature in the ﬁeld with stronger evidence on determinants’ eﬀects and the geographical patterns of responsiveness scores.},

	abstract = {Regression techniques are versatile in their application to medical research because they can measure associations, predict outcomes, and control for confounding variable effects. As one such technique, logistic regression is an efﬁcient and powerful way to analyze the effect of a group of independent variables on a binary outcome by quantifying each independent variable’s unique contribution. Using components of linear regression reﬂected in the logit scale, logistic regression iteratively identiﬁes the strongest linear combination of variables with the greatest probability of detecting the observed outcome. Important considerations when conducting logistic regression include selecting independent variables, ensuring that relevant assumptions are met, and choosing an appropriate model building strategy. For independent variable selection, one should be guided by such factors as accepted theory, previous empirical investigations, clinical considerations, and univariate statistical analyses, with acknowledgement of potential confounding variables that should be accounted for. Basic assumptions that must be met for logistic regression include independence of errors, linearity in the logit for continuous variables, absence of multicollinearity, and lack of strongly inﬂuential outliers. Additionally, there should be an adequate number of events per independent variable to avoid an overﬁt model, with commonly recommended minimum ‘‘rules of thumb’’ ranging from 10 to 20 events per covariate. Regarding model building strategies, the three general types are direct ⁄ standard, sequential ⁄ hierarchical, and stepwise ⁄ statistical, with each having a different emphasis and purpose. Before reaching deﬁnitive conclusions from the results of any of these methods, one should formally quantify the model’s internal validity (i.e., replicability within the same data set) and external validity (i.e., generalizability beyond the current sample). The resulting logistic regression model’s overall ﬁt to the sample data is assessed using various goodness-of-ﬁt measures, with better ﬁt characterized by a smaller difference between observed and model-predicted values. Use of diagnostic statistics is also recommended to further assess the adequacy of the model. Finally, results for independent variables are typically reported as odds ratios (ORs) with 95\% conﬁdence intervals (CIs).},

In fact, criminal choice ceases to be viewed as determined by mental illness or bad attitudes, but it is considered on the basis of a maximization problem in which agents have to compare costs and beneﬁts of legal and illegal activities taking in account the probability of being arrested and punished and the expected returns from crime. Criminal decision is an economic choice by rational agents. In the second part of the survey, in which we focus our attention on empirical works, we present the main recent contributions to the economics of crime; in particular we outline the determinants of criminal behaviours and explore the relationships existing between crime and socioeconomic variables emerging from the literature. In fact, the economics of crime interacts with diﬀerent and heterogeneous ﬁelds (i.e. sociology, criminology, psychiatry and geography). It is closely related to poverty, social exclusion, wage and income inequality, cultural and family background, level of education and other economic and social factors that may aﬀect individual’s propensity to commit crimes such as cultural characteristics, age and sex.},

	abstract = {This study uses panel data of intentional homicide and robbery rates for a sample of developed and developing countries for the period 1970\vphantom{\{}\}1994, based on information from the United Nations World Crime Surveys, to analyze the determinants of national crime rates both across countries and over time. A simple model of the incentives to commit crimes is proposed, which explicitly considers possible causes of the persistence of crime over time (criminal inertia). A panel-data based GMM methodology is used to estimate a dynamic model of national crime rates. This estimator controls for unobserved country-speci"c e!ects, the joint endogeneity of some of the explanatory variables, and the existence of some types of measurement errors a\%icting the crime data. The results show that increases in income inequality raise crime rates, crime tends to be countercyclical, and criminal inertia is signi"cant. 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},
